## Easy
### [Planatary_Gravity_Calculator.py](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/284mep/6142014_challenge_166b_easy_planetary_gravity/)
#### Input Description

You will be given a number M which is the mass of an object in kilograms, on its own line, for example:
> 100

Followed by a number N:

> 4

You will then, on separate lines, be given a list of N planets. This will be given as its name, its radius (in metres), and its average density (in kilograms per cubic metre), like so:

> Mercury, 2439700, 5427

#### Output Description

Print the weight (in Newtons) of the object if it were at the surface of each planet, like so:

> Mercury: 314.623
